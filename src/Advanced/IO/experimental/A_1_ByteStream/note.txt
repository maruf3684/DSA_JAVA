ðŸ“– Refined Explanation: What is socket exactly:

A socket is an OS-managed endpoint for network communication, identified by an IP address and port.

When you open a socket in Java, the OS sets up buffers in kernel space and links them to your process.

Data you write goes into the kernel buffer â†’ network card â†’ other machine.

Data coming in from the network card goes into the kernel buffer â†’ your InputStream.

From your programâ€™s point of view, it feels like reading/writing to a file stream.
