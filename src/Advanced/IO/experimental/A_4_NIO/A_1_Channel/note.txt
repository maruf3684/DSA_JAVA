1. Channel

Think of a Channel like a pipe for data.

Similar to a Stream, but:

Channels are bidirectional (can read & write, unlike streams which are usually one-way).

Channels work with buffers, not directly with bytes/characters.

Common implementations:

FileChannel → for file I/O

SocketChannel → for TCP sockets

ServerSocketChannel → for listening TCP connections

DatagramChannel → for UDP

Example:

RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile("data.txt", "rw");
FileChannel channel = file.getChannel();
