🔹 The Core Fact

In blocking I/O, your Java thread sits in read() or write() doing nothing while the OS kernel is already handling network packets
Your thread is wasted — blocked, not processing anything else.
In non-blocking I/O (Selector), your Java thread doesn’t block:
It sleeps inside selector.select() until the OS tells it “hey, data is ready” or “socket can accept writes.”
While sleeping, it doesn’t waste CPU and can serve many clients when woken up.

So yes 👉 the method (Selector + non-blocking channels):
stops wasting Java threads in the waiting/blocking state,
while the OS kernel threads keep doing their normal job (packet handling, buffering).

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   OS Kernel (driver + TCP/IP stack)         │
│   - Handles incoming packets                │
│   - Copies data to kernel socket buffer     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↑ (marks channel readable)

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Java Thread (Selector loop)               │
│   - SLEEPING inside selector.select()       │
│   - Woken when OS marks a channel ready     │
│   - Copies kernel buffer → user buffer      │
│   - Runs app logic                          │
│   - Returns to selector (sleep again)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘


⚖️ Takeaway:

The OS always uses CPU (it must process packets).
The difference is:
Blocking → your Java threads are stuck waiting.
Non-blocking → your Java threads only wake for real work.
