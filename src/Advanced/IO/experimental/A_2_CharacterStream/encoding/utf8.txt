3. How decoder knows boundaries

When reading a byte:

If it starts with 0, itâ€™s a 1-byte character.

If it starts with 110, expect 1 more byte.

If it starts with 1110, expect 2 more bytes.

If it starts with 11110, expect 3 more bytes.

Continuation bytes are easy to spot because they always start with 10, so you never confuse them with a new character.
